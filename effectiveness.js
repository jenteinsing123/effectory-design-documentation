    aiIntro: "The IT team’s results indicate several challenges impacting overall effectiveness and employee experience. Engagement (56%) and retention (57%) are below desired levels, suggesting employees may feel disconnected from the organization and uncertain about their long-term future within the team. Workload scores are particularly low at 38%, highlighting concerns around capacity, prioritization, and sustainable ways of working. While the eNPS score of 12 remains positive, it indicates only moderate advocacy and suggests there is significant room for improvement in employee satisfaction and loyalty.",
    aiMore: ["As the team falls within the ineffective quadrant, focused action is required to address workload pressures, strengthen leadership support, and improve employee engagement. Creating greater clarity around priorities, improving resource allocation, and increasing opportunities for employee feedback may help rebuild trust and team effectiveness."],
    aiStrengths: [
      "eNPS remains positive at 12, indicating that a portion of employees are still willing to recommend the organization as a place to work.",
      "Retention sentiment (57%) suggests that more than half of employees currently see themselves remaining with the organization."
    ],
    aiGrowth: [
      "Workload (38%) is significantly below desired levels and appears to be a key driver of employee dissatisfaction.",
      "Engagement (56%) indicates employees may not feel fully connected to team goals or motivated by their current work environment.",
      "Retention (57%) presents a potential risk for future turnover if underlying concerns are not addressed."
    ],
    aiActions: [
      "Review team capacity, workload distribution, and project prioritization to reduce pressure on employees.",
      "Conduct listening sessions to better understand the factors contributing to lower engagement and retention.",
      "Increase transparency around team objectives, decision-making, and career development opportunities.",
      "Equip managers with tools and training to support employee wellbeing, recognition, and performance conversations.",

    dateFrom: '22 Apr 2026', dateTo: '22 May 2026',
    aiIntro: "Across Novanta, this survey points to a mixed picture. Organization-wide engagement stands at 66% with retention at 70% — most employees are reasonably committed, but energy is not yet translating into a supportive performance environment everywhere. An eNPS of 20 and a response rate of 77% give a workable read on where the organization stands.",
    aiMore: [
      "Several departments sit in the not-fully-utilized quadrant: people are motivated, but workload pressure and unclear ways of working hold them back. A focused effort on the performance environment is likely to unlock the engagement that is already there.",
      "Prioritizing workload, clarity and manager support across the lower-scoring teams will help Novanta convert this potential into stronger, more sustainable results."
    ],
    aiStrengths: [
      "Engagement (66%) is reasonable organization-wide and provides a base to build on.",
      "Retention (70%) shows most employees still intend to stay with Novanta.",
      "A response rate of 77% gives a workable view of the organization."
    ],
    aiGrowth: [
      "Workload (54%) is under pressure in many departments and is a key barrier.",
      "The performance environment lags engagement, suggesting unclear ways of working.",
      "Development opportunities score low and need attention."
    ],
    aiActions: [
      "Tackle workload and prioritization in the most pressured departments first.",
      "Give managers clearer guidance and support to improve the performance environment.",
      "Increase transparency around priorities and decision-making.",
      "Create more room for development and recognition.",
      "Set measurable goals per department and revisit them next cycle."
