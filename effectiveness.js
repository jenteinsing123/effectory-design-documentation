    aiIntro: "The IT team’s results indicate several challenges impacting overall effectiveness and employee experience. Engagement (56%) and retention (57%) are below desired levels, suggesting employees may feel disconnected from the organization and uncertain about their long-term future within the team. Workload scores are particularly low at 38%, highlighting concerns around capacity, prioritization, and sustainable ways of working. While the eNPS score of 12 remains positive, it indicates only moderate advocacy and suggests there is significant room for improvement in employee satisfaction and loyalty.",
    aiMore: ["As the team falls within the ineffective quadrant, focused action is required to address workload pressures, strengthen leadership support, and improve employee engagement. Creating greater clarity around priorities, improving resource allocation, and increasing opportunities for employee feedback may help rebuild trust and team effectiveness."],
    aiStrengths: [
      "eNPS remains positive at 12, indicating that a portion of employees are still willing to recommend the organization as a place to work.",

      "Workload (38%) is significantly below desired levels and appears to be a key driver of employee dissatisfaction.",
      "Engagement (56%) indicates employees may not feel fully connected to team goals or motivated by their current work environment.",
      "Retention (57%) presents a potential risk for future turnover if underlying concerns are not addressed."
    ],
    aiActions: [
      "Review team capacity, workload distribution, and project prioritization to reduce pressure on employees.",
      "Conduct listening sessions to better understand the factors contributing to lower engagement and retention.",

      "Equip managers with tools and training to support employee wellbeing, recognition, and performance conversations.",
